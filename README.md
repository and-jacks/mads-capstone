# NYC Transit Ridership Forecast Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict **NYC transit ridership** using a combination of historical ridership data, **weather information**, and event data. It leverages machine learning models to forecast hourly ridership at various stations, providing insights into transit usage trends and aiding in resource planning.

### Project Goals

- **Predict hourly transit ridership** for NYC subway stations.
- Incorporate **weather data** to understand its impact on ridership.
- Use **machine learning models** like Random Forest, time series, LSTM, and others.  add more--- for predictions.
